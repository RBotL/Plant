# Plant

The project is focused on the task of plant disease classification using the New Plant Disease dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset.

In this project, we explore the application of CNNs and transfer learning using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, for plant image classification. 
The project consists of three main tasks: binary plant classification, plant species categorization, and plant-disease classification.
In the binary plant classification task, we aim to classify plants into two categories: healthy and non-healthy.
In the plant categorization task, our objective is to classify the plants into 14 different categories, based on their species, regardless of their diseases. 
Finally, in the plant-disease classification task, we aimed to classify plants into 38 categories based on both the plant species and diseases.
